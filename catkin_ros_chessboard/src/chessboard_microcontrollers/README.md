# ar3_microcontrollers
This module contains the microcontroller firmware for the sensor chessboard. 

## Teensy
There are Arduino sketches provided for Arduino Mega 2560 using the ROS noetic node topic communication.

* `sensor_chessboard_script` provide real-time status update by Arduino Mega 2560.

* `sensor_chessboard_script_test` is used for get real-time voltage data received by Arduino Mega 2560 from sensor array for the recommissioning of the machine.
