# ar3_microcontrollers
This module contains the microcontroller firmware for the AR3. 

## Teensy
There are Arduino sketches provided for the Teensy 4.1 and Arduino Mega 2560.  

* `baseline_with_ARCS_jcheng2020_revised_asyn_IO_com_version` is using the asynchronous receive and transmit model for AR3 control with Teensy 4.1

* `baseline_with_ARCS_jcheng2020_revised_rosnode_com_version` is using the ROS noetic node topic communication for test purpose for AR3 control with Teensy 4.1

* `gripper_driver_microcontroller` is using the asynchronous receive and transmit model for vex gripper control with Arduino Mega 2560
