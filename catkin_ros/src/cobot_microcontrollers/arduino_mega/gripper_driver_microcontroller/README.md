# Instructions to set up the circuit for the gripper
* Set up a 7.5 volts DC power supply for the gripper on the Vex Motor Controller 29
* Make 7.5 volts DC power supply and Arduino Mega 2560 (gripper) common ground
* Connect Pin 9 of Arduino Mega 2560 (gripper) with the white pin of the VEX Motor Controller 29 for the control signal.
Circuit Digram Connection between Arduino Mega 2560 and Vex Motor Controller 29 is as shown below:
