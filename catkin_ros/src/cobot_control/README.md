# cobot_control
This module contains sample code for motion planning with the MoveIt API. There is currently a demo for the move group interface which has been adapted for the AR3 from the tutorials. There is much more to the MoveIt API, do check out the [official MoveIt tutorials](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/index.html).


* **rviz_tools_gui**  
  You will need to add the rviz_tools_gui to step through the demo. You can do so with `Panels -> Add New Panel -> RvizVisualToolsGui`.

* **Marker Array**  
  `Add -> By display type -> MarkerArray` to view the poses and trajectories.
